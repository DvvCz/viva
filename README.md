# viva

Experimental cli to create HDL projects using Vivado, outside of their IDE.

## How

This uses the TCL api provided by vivado to create and manage a project.

It's not too dissimilar from another one of my projects, [cpkg](https://github.com/DvvCz/cpkg)

## Why

Working in the Vivado IDE is not ideal for some people (me).

Having a clean repo with purely source files and one readable toml file is a huge win for me.

In comparison to hosting a project generated by Vivado with large overbearing xml files, and a lot of folders unnecessarily splitting up your code.
